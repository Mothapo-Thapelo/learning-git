# Learning Git and Github

Version control is an essential skill for developers to master, and Git is by far the most popular version control system on the web. Combined with the popular GitHub website to explore existing projects, clone them to your local hard drive, and use them as templates for your new projects. Then! You have the ultimate time machine as a developer.
